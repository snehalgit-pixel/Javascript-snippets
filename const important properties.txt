const does not allow the data type to be overridden. 

const example={} is an empty object. We can assign data values to this empty object in the subsequent lines.
However example=3 will produce an error.

const e=[1,2,3,4];
e.push(5);------> does not produce an error. There's nothing wrong with this statement.
Array operations are alllowed in a const array.
