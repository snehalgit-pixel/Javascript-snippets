JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.
It is used to transfer data from a server to a web page.
Data is in name:value pairs.
Curly braces {} hold the objects.
Square braces [] hold the arrays.
JSON format is syntactically similar to  jacascript objects. This is why it is easy to convert JSON data into javascript objects.
We can convert a javascript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert a string into a javascript object.
The javascript file practice22.js contains a demonstration of JSON.parse() operation.
