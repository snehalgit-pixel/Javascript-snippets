call()
The utility of call() is that it takes an object as an argument and binds the object to the this reference.
It has two applications:
(i) To call the function and execute it.
(ii) To bind the object passed on as an argument to the this reference.

__proto()__
In javaScript, a function object has a prototype object.
Every function object has a prototype property that points to the prototype object.
If we have a function named greet(), then simply typing greet.prorotype() in the console will display the prototype object in the greet() function.

prototype property in Javascript allows us to add new properties and methods to the object constructors.

practice24.js depicts exactly how this is useful and how this allows us to add new methods to the object constructors.

Every object has a prototype. The prototype of an object has __proto__. __proto__ points to null.
